Tunnelblick (https://tunnelblick.net/) comes with signed tun/tap
drivers, courtesy of Tunnelblick developers.

For root shell or via sudo:

kextutil -d /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/tap-signed.kext -b net.tunnelblick.tap

See:

Tunnelblick no longer uses tuntap, but rather Darwin's own utun device
(see above).  It still graciously includes a signed version of the
tuntap driver, though, which loads fine at least on 10.10.x 

To check (at root shell):
# kextstat | grep tunnel
   should show a line with "net.tunnelblick.tap"
