Kext module signing can be disabled by changing a setting in NVRAM
(and rebooting, oh joy). The best procedure seems to be:

1. Run "sudo nvram boot-args" to list existing settings.

E.g.:
$ sudo nvram boot-args
boot-args debug=0x10

2. Add "kext-dev-mode=1" to boot-args (as a comma-separated list if
   needed, see below).

E.g.:
$ sudo nvram boot-args=debug=0x10,kext-dev-mode=1

3. Reboot :(

4. To re-enable kext signing, remove "kext-dev-mode=1" from the nvram
   boot-args list. Reboot.

Note: debug=0x10 is needed to bypass an OS X 10.10 bug that makes
      VMWare Fusion very very slow.

Mac OS X, it just works.

From http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/163059/how-can-i-disable-kext-signing-in-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite :

To disable the kext signing security setting:

sudo nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1

After changing this setting you need to restart the computer to have
OS X recognize it.

It is important to note that the kext-signing setting is global, if
you disable it you should be careful to only install system drivers
from sources that you trust.

To reenable again use:

sudo nvram -d boot-args

  Careful: You may already have set other boot-args (I did, to enable
  old-style external monitor behavior on my Macbook). To check, use the
  command nvram boot-args. If that prints any values (e.g. "iog=0x0"),
  add them to the above command using a comma, like this: sudo nvram
  boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1,iog=0x0. Then, to disable the
  kext-dev-mode, do not use the "-d" command but rather omit that part
  when setting the old boot-args. – Thomas Tempelmann Jan 7 at 20:33
   	 
  I have a MacPro 4.1 and the "nvram boot-args=kext-dev-mode=1"
  command doesn't save the value persistent in the NVRAM. When I look
  with "nvram -p" directly after setting it, it prints out the
  value. After a reboot, it's gone. How can that happen, or better,
  how can that be repaired? – konran May 4 at 15:39
   	 
    Ok, my question is solved: the Mavericks-to-Yosemite upgrade broke
    the NVRAM. After a NVRAM-reset the boot-args value keeps stored.
